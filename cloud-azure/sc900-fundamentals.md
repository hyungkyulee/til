## the shared responsibility model ##
The responsibilities vary depending on where the workload is hosted:
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- On-premises datacenter

## defense in depth ##
Example layers of security
- Physical security (eg. firewall level) - limiting access to a datacenter to only authorized personnel.
- Identity and access security controls - multifactor authentication or condition-based access, to control access to infrastructure and change control.
- Perimeter security - your corporate network includes distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.
- Network security (eg. VM level) - network segmentation and network access controls, to limit communication between resources. (retro movement, vm-vm protection)
- Compute layer security - securing access to virtual machines either on-premises or in the cloud by closing certain ports.
- Application layer security - to ensure applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities.
- Data layer security - controls to manage access to business and customer data and encryption to protect data.

## Zero Trust model ##
Principles
- verify explicitly
- least privileged access
- assume breach

Six foundational pillars
- identities - users, services, or devices
- devices - create a large attack surface as data flows (monitoring the devices by health-check and complicance)
- applications - the way that data is consumed (managing permissions and access)
- data - be classified, labeled, and encrypted on its attributes
  - Exemple of Security Policy at Azure
    - mandatory encryption to store data
    - bitlocker at disk
  - How to work
    - encryption key is owned by microsoft
    - encryption key working with user's key
- infrastructure - access the version, configuration, and JIT access, and use telemetry to detect attacks
- networks - should be segmented (employing real-time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, monitoring, and analytics)
