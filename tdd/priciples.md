# Priciples of TDD

## The cycle of TDD
### The Three Laws of TDD
- rule
  - failed test first
  - not more than a test
  - not more than production code
  
- R-G-R cycle : Red, Gree, Refactor
  - write a failing test
  - pass a production test on code
  - refactor to make it faster

- Taglines
  - Make it work, Make it right, Make it fast

## Types of Software Testing
- Unit testing : single(isolated) case or group of code, and input to output matching test
- Itegration testing : group of components togeter under a specific hardware
- Performance testing : speed of system
- Usability testing : user perspectives w.r.t. how to satisfy them or their needs
- Acceptance testing : a requirement from users
- Regression testing : a modification of the existing service/product
