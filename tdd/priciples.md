# Priciples of TDD

## The cycle of TDD
### The Three Laws of TDD
- rule
  - failed test first
  - not more than a test
  - not more than production code
  
- R-G-R cycle : Red, Gree, Refactor
  - write a failing test
  - pass a production test on code
  - refactor to make it faster

- Taglines
  - Make it work, Make it right, Make it fast

- Arrange
- Act
- Assert
